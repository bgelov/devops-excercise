# Introduction

We are building an infrastructure that consists of multiple applications.
One application is written in PHP and connects to a MySQL server.
Another is written in node.js and is fairly static.
We want to balance both these applications and be able to spin off more application
services if needed. Both applications should be behind SSL and do an SSL termination,
so all internal requests happen without SSL.

## Components

1 nodejs application
1 php application
1 php-fpm 8.2
1 MySQL database
1 HaProxy
1 Nginx as SSL termination

### Assumptions

1. The infrastructure is running on a Linux machine
2. To use docker or not is up to the candidate
3. The infrastructure is running on a single machine,
   but leave room for it to be split into multiple machines later

# Task

Use ansible to create repeatable infrastructure that can quickly spin off mentioned
applications. Take a note of everything additional you have to add, to make it production
ready. Include all necessary steps to setup machine from scratch, keeping in mind
security and performance.

Provide a way to run the infrastructure locally, so it can be tested. Add all necessary
comments that you think will help us understand your thought process.

Take a note on how much time you spent on the task.
